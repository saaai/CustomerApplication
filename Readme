Folder Structure of CLI Project Angular 6 :
- Dist 
    - Dist folder is where the final compiled Java Script source code is. 
    - when the Project is compiled all the TS files are converted to JS.
    - The final output which we will take to production is all there in the dist folder.

- node_modules
    - whatever npm install we do, all those packages will get copied in this node_modules folder.

- e2e
    - end to end testing, this is where we will write our white box test. These white box tests will be fired on the source code.
    
- Src
    - Inside src folder we have something called app, where we will write all our source code.
