Folder Structure of CLI Project Angular 6 :
- Dist 
    - Dist folder is where the final compiled Java Script source code is. 
    - when the Project is compiled all the TS files are converted to JS.
    - The final output which we will take to production is all there in the dist folder.

- node_modules
    - whatever npm install we do, all those packages will get copied in this node_modules folder.

- e2e
    - end to end testing, this is where we will write our white box test. These white box tests will be fired on the source code.
    
- Src
    - Inside src folder we have something called app, where we will write all our source code.

- If you see the angular applications, it has 3 big technologies that work together.
    - Angular framework.
    - Type script which helps us to tranform into JS.
    - Node which is our packages manager.
        - So, for each one of these technologies it needs configuration files.
        - These JSON files which we see out in the project folder, Angular.json, package.json, tsconfig.json. these are all 3 configuration files for all these 3 technologies.
        - Angular - angular.json
        - Node - package.json
        - Typescript - tsconfig.json

- tslint.json file is used during the linting process, this process is used to check the source code for any errors. 
    Errors can be programmatic error or it can be stylistic errors. So, these checks are done during the coding phase itself.
    ex: if i write something in the code file during the coding phase itself it will say there is some error.
